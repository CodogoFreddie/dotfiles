    "description": "When writing automated unit tests for your application you will probably need to use mocks at some point. Classical object-oriented programming languages such as PHP solve this with reflection where mock object types are created during test runtime. The code under test expects a certain interface or class and the test code passes mock objects that implement the interface or are a subclass.",
