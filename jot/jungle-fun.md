# Jungle Fun

Deep in the Jungle of Kal'Azune lies a generically ethnic temple of ancient and indeterminate origin. It is spoken of in hushed tones through out the civilised world as the last great un-plundered hoard of barbarous treasure on Earth. Many have attempted to take the treasure that must be hidden within for themselves, but few have ever returned. And those that do speak of fearsome trials, traps, and challenges that bar the way.

Many academics have begun to dismiss The Temple of Kal'Azune as a myth, but _you_ feel in your heart that it must be real. A few months ago you received a letter from an anonymous person who said they were assembling a team to finally retrieve The Treasure, and that your specific skills were needed to complete the team. The letter told you to catch a boat to Zazalon, the largest port of Kal'Azune, where you would meet the rest of your team.

## Building your character

### Stats

There are 4 stats used in the game:

- **Brawn** Measures your physical strength and hardiness
- **Litheness** Measures your grace, poise, and agility
- **Guile** Measures your street smarts and ability to read others
- **Artifice** Measures your book smarts and knowledge

Each stat starts at `0`, when creating your character you can move points between each stat, up to a max of `+3`, and a minimum of `-2`. All checks are done with a d6, if you roll a 6 you roll again and add the next value onto your total; only add your modifier once.

Your max health is `10 + ( Brawn * 3 ) + Litheness`

### Narrative

Each character has

#### A goal

Why are they seeking the treasure of Kal'Azune? What do they seek to gain? What drives them? This is entirely up to you

#### A person they know

Before you create your character the DM will pair you up with another player. You must come up with a shared backstory: are you ex-lovers, rivals, old friends, did one kill the other's parents? You don't need to tell the other player everything about your character, but you should agree on what it is your characters share

#### A troubled past

Once you've decided on most of the characterisation of your character, the DM will work with you to create a troubled past. You should both agree on what this is, the DM shouldn't force you to make any decisions that you don't think work with your character.

### Other

You also have:

- 1 Weapon (aligned with on of the 4 stats, eg: club === brawn)
- 2 Minor items (first aid kit, rope, flint and tinder, etc...)
- 1 Special Skill
- 100 of her Majesties Great British Pounds

Although you have to pre-define these before you begin playing, they can have quite ephemeral uses. E.G: your special skill could be `"Dance"`, which you could use to:

- Communicate with savages that don't speak the language
- Evade a grid of lasers
- Entrance a businessman.

All uses of items and skills is at the discretion of the DM.
