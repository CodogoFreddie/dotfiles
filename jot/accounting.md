### Questions I want answered

- [x] Why can't I setup a payroll run for my self?
  - Need to call a number, to get my tax code which i'll then email back to accountant.
- [x] I've still not recieved a letter from HMRC
  - might take a while, check in in a week.
- [x] Is there a limit to how much I can pay in pensions, do pension payments reduce my tax liability?
  - limit is 40k per tax year,
  - they will setup a call with a pension provider
  - comes out as an expense, so reduces tax liablity as it's not a dividend or salary
  - they will send an article
- [x] Does it make more sense to contribute to charity through my business
  - can make it as a company, will be recorded in self assessment
  - they will send an article
- [x] What's the most efficient way to pay a minimimum of student loans repayment?
  - isn't really affected by salary/dividend split
  - pension is not included, as it's a buisness expense
- [x] Is there any real point to me getting a buisness savings account?
  - other than having a slight interest rate, not much point.
- [x] should I keep personal tax money in the buisness account, or in my own personal account?
  - doens't functonally matter, personal might be better
