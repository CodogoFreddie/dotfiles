Compression is an audio effect that reduces [[Dynamic Range]] by reducing the loudness of the loudest parts of an audio signal. "Makeup Gain" is often used, so that in effect, the loudest parts stay where they were, and the quieter parts become louder.

---

- A signal varies from -50dB to -10dB
- Introduce Compression starting at -30dB, with a ratio of 2.0
- Now, every dB above -30dB is halved, so the signal varies from -50dB to -20 dB
- If we add a Makeup Gain of +10dB, the signa varies from -40dB to -10dB
