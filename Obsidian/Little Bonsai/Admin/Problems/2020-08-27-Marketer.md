We need a [[Marketer]].

We're currently in a position where we can produce really high quality content, get it put on and _Promote_ it (like AiE, if we're given a structure to work in we can _Advertise_ the hell out of something), but I don't think we've got the skills to do direct cold marketing to our online audience.

The role we're missing is a mix of [[Marketer]] and [[Comunity Manager]], we've said that we'll use [[Dolly Hill]] to fill this role, but we've not actually talked about

- Who will do the work
- What schedule
- What work
	- Post where?
	- Join Comunities?
	- Write fan content?
	- Tv Tropes
	- Basically what's the game plan

We need to be spending a ceartain number of hours per month on this, or all our content will die on the vine
